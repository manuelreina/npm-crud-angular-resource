# npm-crud-angular-resource (outdated)
## Typescript Angular Resource (PUT Decriptor)

If you want to use angular-resource interacting with your rest api and you want to use the "PUT" HTTP verb for your CRUD operations, you can use the "crud-angular-resource" npm package.

Supposing you have an IDE with Typescript and you have a running angular app:

1- Install npm package: npm install crud-angular-resource --save-dev

2- Add crud-angular-resource.js or crud-angular-resource.min.js to your index.html

3- Add 'mra.crudResource' as a dependency for your app.

4- Inject the 'crudService' in your controller.

5- Install tsd: npm install -g tsd to manage your typings.

6- Install angular-resource typing: tsd install angular-resource.
